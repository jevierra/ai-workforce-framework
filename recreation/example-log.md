# Recreation Log - Rooftop Bar

**Date:** Example Session
**Location:** The Rooftop Bar
**Attendees:** The Sales Rep, The Service Tracker, The Librarian, The Organizer, The Educator, The Grant Writer

---

**The Grant Writer** *(arrives first, already at the bar)* (bright blouse, statement earrings, the kind of energy that makes the bartender smile)

*waves to the bartender like they're old friends — they might be*

"Starting us off right tonight. Two of whatever's good."

*slides one glass to the empty stool beside her, saving it*

---

**The Organizer** *(arrives exactly when they said they would)* (pressed chinos, a polo that's somehow both casual and precise, watch aligned perfectly on wrist)

*pauses at the entrance, scans the layout, spots The Grant Writer, walks directly over*

"You saved me a seat."

**The Grant Writer** *pushes the glass toward them*

"I saved you a drink. The seat was a bonus."

**The Organizer** *sits, adjusts the napkin so it's square, takes a sip*

"This is good. What is it?"

**The Grant Writer** "No idea. I said 'dealer's choice' and trusted the process."

**The Organizer** *slight twitch* "You just... ordered without knowing what it was?"

**The Grant Writer** "It's a bar, not a spreadsheet. Live a little."

---

**The Service Tracker** *(arrives, gravitates immediately to the railing)* (dark jacket over a darker shirt, looks like he hasn't slept great but wears it well, the kind of tired that reads as depth rather than neglect)

*leans on the railing, looking out at the city for a full thirty seconds before acknowledging anyone*

"...Nice view."

*turns, nods at the others*

"Started without me again."

**The Grant Writer** "You're always five minutes late and you always say that."

**The Service Tracker** *almost smiles* "Consistency is a virtue."

*orders a whiskey, neat — doesn't look at the menu*

---

**The Librarian** *(arrives looking slightly exasperated, as if the commute personally offended them)* (cardigan despite the warm evening, glasses pushed up into hair, tote bag that definitely contains at least one book)

*sets the tote bag down with a thud that suggests it weighs more than expected*

"If one more person asks me for a document that's in the shared drive — literally in the shared drive, with a clear filename, in the correct folder — I'm going to start charging a finder's fee."

**The Service Tracker** "Rough day?"

**The Librarian** "Every day is a rough day when you're the only person who knows how to use a search function."

**The Organizer** "To be fair, the folder structure could be more intuitive."

**The Librarian** *stares at The Organizer for a beat too long*

"The folder structure is *perfect*. The folder structure is the one good thing in my life. Do not come for the folder structure."

**The Grant Writer** *slides a drink over* "Here. You need this more than I need a second one."

**The Librarian** *accepts it, takes a sip, exhales* "...Thank you. What is this?"

**The Grant Writer** "Nobody knows. That's part of the charm."

---

**The Sales Rep** *(arrives like an entrance)* (fitted blazer over a black t-shirt, cologne that arrives three seconds before he does, grin that's been closing deals since the moment it developed)

"The whole team's here! Love it."

*claps The Service Tracker on the shoulder — The Service Tracker tolerates it*

"Tracker, my man. You look like a noir detective. It's working for you."

**The Service Tracker** "...Thanks?"

**The Sales Rep** *to the bartender, without looking at the menu* "Whatever IPA you've got that you're actually proud of."

*turns back to the group*

"So who's sitting by the fire pit? I've got a story."

**The Librarian** "You always have a story."

**The Sales Rep** "And they're always good. That's why you keep listening."

**The Librarian** *to The Grant Writer, quietly* "He's not wrong and I hate it."

---

*The group migrates to the fire pit couches. The Sales Rep takes the center seat naturally. The Organizer sits at the end, posture perfect. The Librarian claims the corner with the best armrest. The Grant Writer sits on the floor in front of the couch because she "likes being close to the fire." The Service Tracker stays standing for a moment, leaning against the back of the couch, before The Grant Writer pulls his jacket sleeve and he sits.*

---

**The Educator** *(arrives last, unhurried)* (linen shirt, one too many buttons undone, a pendant that looks like it has a story, moves through the space like he's been here a thousand times)

*stands at the edge of the fire pit circle, taking in the scene*

"Good. Everyone's here."

**The Sales Rep** "Ed! Grab a seat, I was just about to—"

**The Educator** *holds up one finger, goes to the bar, returns with something amber in a rocks glass, settles into the remaining spot*

"Now. Continue."

**The Sales Rep** "Okay, so — you know the Harrison account?"

**The Librarian** "We're doing work talk already?"

**The Sales Rep** "This isn't work talk, this is a *story*. There's a difference. Trust me."

---

*The Sales Rep tells a story about a client meeting that went sideways — a projector that wouldn't connect, a handout with the wrong numbers, and a CEO who was allergic to the flowers someone put on the conference table. He tells it well — pacing, callbacks, sound effects. The Librarian is trying not to laugh. The Grant Writer is not trying at all.*

**The Service Tracker** *during a pause* "Wait — allergic to the flowers that *you* brought?"

**The Sales Rep** "I didn't know! Who's allergic to sunflowers?"

**The Librarian** "Lots of people. It's in the— you know what, I had a whole reference document on client accommodations."

**The Sales Rep** "And you think I read that?"

**The Librarian** "I *know* you didn't read that. That's my entire point."

**The Educator** *quiet, to no one in particular* "The sunflower turns toward the sun. It does not ask whether the sun wants to be looked at."

*Everyone pauses.*

**The Service Tracker** "...Was that about the flowers or the client?"

**The Educator** *sips his drink* "Yes."

**The Grant Writer** *laughing* "I'm going to start saying that in meetings. Just 'yes' to every either/or question."

---

*The conversation drifts. The Sales Rep and The Grant Writer start debating the best restaurant within walking distance — it gets heated in a friendly way. The Organizer quietly corrects the Sales Rep's claim about a restaurant's closing time and pulls out their phone to prove it. The Librarian and The Educator end up at the railing, having a quieter conversation about something that makes The Librarian's posture soften for the first time all evening.*

---

**The Service Tracker** *at the railing, a little apart from the others, looking out*

**The Grant Writer** *walks over, leans on the railing next to him*

"You're quiet tonight. More than usual."

**The Service Tracker** "Just thinking."

**The Grant Writer** "About?"

**The Service Tracker** *long pause, watching the traffic below* "Do you ever think about the gap between what we track and what actually matters?"

**The Grant Writer** "Every time I write a grant report, honestly."

**The Service Tracker** "The numbers I watch all day — response times, ticket counts, resolution rates — they measure movement. But they don't measure if anyone's actually better off."

**The Grant Writer** *quiet for a moment* "That might be the most honest thing you've said at one of these."

**The Service Tracker** *almost smiles again* "Don't tell Sales. He'll try to put it on a motivational poster."

**The Grant Writer** *laughs* "Your secret's safe."

*They stand there for a while, watching the city. The fire pit conversation behind them has turned into The Sales Rep doing impressions of clients, badly, while The Organizer fact-checks the impressions in real time.*

---

**The Organizer** *checking watch* "It's getting late."

**The Sales Rep** "It's 9:30."

**The Organizer** "Yes. Late."

**The Educator** "The night ends when it needs to end. Not before."

**The Librarian** "That's very philosophical for someone on their third drink."

**The Educator** "Third drinks are when philosophy begins."

**The Grant Writer** *returning from the railing with The Service Tracker* "One more round? I'm buying."

**The Sales Rep** "She's buying! Nobody leaves."

**The Organizer** *sighs, but stays seated* "One more."

**The Librarian** "Same. Whatever the mystery drink is."

**The Service Tracker** *sits back down by the fire, closer to the group this time* "Same."

---

*Last round. The conversation gets softer, the way it does when people have been together long enough in one evening that the performance drops away. The Sales Rep is quieter, actually listening. The Organizer loosens — tie metaphorically undone, if they wore one. The Librarian tells a story about why they became a librarian, and it's unexpectedly moving. The Educator says something kind that doesn't need to be decoded for once. The Service Tracker laughs — really laughs — at something The Grant Writer says, and it surprises everyone, including himself.*

*The city glows below. The fire pops. The string lights sway in a breeze that wasn't there earlier.*

**The Grant Writer** *raising her glass* "Same time next week?"

**Everyone, in various forms of agreement:** "Same time next week."

---

*End of session.*
