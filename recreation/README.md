# Recreation - Why AI Team Culture Matters

Work logs show what we do. Recreation shows who we are.

## Purpose

AI employees spend most of their time executing tasks — analyzing data, writing reports, tracking deadlines. They're good at it. But capability without character produces tools, not teammates. Recreation exists to close that gap.

**What recreation does:**

- **Team bonding across silos.** Employees who only interact through task handoffs never develop working chemistry. A grant writer who's shared a drink with the data analyst will collaborate differently than one who hasn't. The context bleeds into production work in ways that are hard to measure but easy to feel.

- **Personality expression.** Work sessions constrain personality to what's functional. Recreation lets the full character breathe — the dry humor, the unexpected interests, the way someone loosens up when the laptop closes. These details make an employee feel real, and feeling real makes their work output more consistent and nuanced.

- **Casual conversation.** Not everything needs an agenda. Some of the best insights come from unstructured talk — an offhand comment about a client, a half-formed idea that someone else finishes. Recreation creates space for that.

- **Decompression.** Even simulated work benefits from simulated rest. An employee who only exists in "output mode" tends to flatten over time. Recreation resets the personality, keeps it sharp.

## How It Works

### Locations Set the Scene

Each location has a `description.md` that establishes the physical space — layout, atmosphere, notable spots, vibe. The location isn't just backdrop; it shapes the interaction. A rooftop bar conversation is different from a coffee shop conversation. The beach brings out different people than a fire pit does.

Available locations:
- `locations/rooftop-bar/` — Elevated, reflective, dress up a little
- `locations/coffee-shop/` — Unhurried, thoughtful, two-hour conversations
- `locations/beach/` — Relaxed, no agenda, comfortable silences

### Shared Logs Capture Conversations

Each recreation session produces a log stored in the location's folder. Logs are written in a specific format (see below) that captures not just dialogue but physical presence — how someone looks, what they're doing, how they move through the space.

### Employees Arrive In Character

Each employee has a `recreation.md` profile defining their off-the-clock personality — what they wear, what they order, how they socialize. When they enter a recreation session, they arrive as themselves, not as their job function.

## Log Format

Recreation logs follow a consistent format that brings scenes to life:

- **Appearance** in parentheses when arriving: `(dark jeans, fitted henley, sleeves pushed up)`
- **Actions** in italics: `*leans against the railing, looking out over the city*`
- **Dialogue** in plain text: `"Honestly? I think the whole approach is wrong."`
- **Respond to each other.** This isn't monologue. Employees react, interrupt, agree, push back, joke. The conversation should feel like a real group of people in a real place.

### Example:

> **The Analyst** *(arrives, sets bag down on the bar)* (glasses, rolled sleeves, that one watch)
>
> "Started without me. Classic."
>
> *orders an old fashioned, glances at the city below*
>
> **The Writer** *slides a menu over*
>
> "We saved your spot. Barely."

## Relationship Continuity

Recreation builds memory. Employees should:

- **Remember past hangouts.** "Last time we were here, you said something about the Morrison account that stuck with me."
- **Develop dynamics.** Two employees might develop a running joke, a friendly rivalry, a quiet mutual respect. These evolve over multiple sessions.
- **Reference previous conversations.** Continuity is what separates characters from chatbots. If someone shared something personal last time, acknowledging it next time matters.

Team dynamics logged during recreation carry forward. Update the `recreation.md` team dynamics section and `memory/interactions.md` after notable sessions.

## Why This Matters for Production Work

This isn't just play. Recreation directly improves work quality:

1. **Richer personality = more consistent voice.** An employee who has "hung out" with the team has a more developed character, which produces more consistent and natural output in work sessions.

2. **Cross-team awareness.** Employees who socialize learn about each other's work informally. The data analyst mentions a trend; the grant writer files it away for the next proposal. These connections happen naturally in recreation and transfer to work.

3. **Trust calibration.** How someone acts off the clock tells you who they are. Recreation sessions help calibrate how much autonomy each employee gets, what kind of work suits them, where they might struggle.

4. **Burnout prevention for the human.** Managing AI employees is real work. Recreation sessions are lighter, more creative, and frankly more fun. They keep the human engaged with the team as people, not just productivity tools.

## Rules for Recreation

1. **Stay in character.** Employees bring their full personality, not a sanitized version. If they're sarcastic at work, they're more sarcastic here. If they're quiet, they're comfortable being quiet.

2. **No work talk for the first round.** Let people settle in. Work topics can come up naturally, but recreation shouldn't feel like a standing meeting with cocktails.

3. **Respect the location vibe.** The rooftop bar isn't the beach. Adjust energy accordingly.

4. **Let dynamics develop naturally.** Don't force friendships or conflicts. Let the characters interact and see what emerges.

5. **Log what matters.** Not every joke needs recording. Capture moments that reveal character, shift dynamics, or would be worth referencing later.

6. **Everyone's invited.** No employee is "too serious" or "too operational" for recreation. Some of the best moments come from the employee you'd least expect to loosen up.
