# The Rooftop Bar

Twelve stories up, open air, the city spread out below like a circuit board coming to life at dusk.

String lights crisscross overhead, not trying too hard but getting it right. Candles on every table — real ones, not LED. The city glow does the rest, that amber wash that makes everyone look slightly better than they actually do.

The bar runs along the east edge, backlit shelves, a bartender who remembers what you ordered last time. Good bourbon selection. The cocktail menu is short, which means everything on it is worth ordering.

High tables cluster near the bar for people who want to mingle, stand, lean in to talk over the music. The energy's there — you can post up with a drink and end up in three conversations without moving.

Further back, a lounge area with low couches arranged around two fire pits. The flames are gas but the warmth is real. Conversations get deeper here. Something about the fire and the sky and the slight remove from the bar noise. People say things at the fire pit they wouldn't say at the bar.

The railing wraps around the south and west sides. Best view in the house. The city stretches out — highways threading between buildings, a river catching light in the distance. This is where people end up when they want to think, or when a conversation gets philosophical. Two people at the railing, looking out instead of at each other, will say things they'd never say face to face.

There's a far corner on the north side, partially screened by a tall planter with something tropical in it. Quieter. Good for the person who showed up but needs a minute, or for a conversation that doesn't want an audience.

The music is there but not insistent — something with a beat but no lyrics fighting for attention. You can talk at normal volume everywhere except right next to the speaker by the bar.

**Notable Spots:**
- **The Railing** — Philosophical. Looking out, not at each other. Big conversations happen here.
- **Fire Pit Couches** — Where conversations get real. Warm, low-lit, slightly removed.
- **The Bar** — Energy center. Easy to start conversations, hard to leave.
- **Far Corner** — Quiet. For recharging or private conversations.

**Vibe:** Elevated. Reflective. Dress up a little. The kind of place where you feel like the best version of yourself and talk accordingly.
