# The Coffee Shop

Corner shop on a street that's busy enough to feel alive but quiet enough to hear yourself think. Exposed brick on two walls, the other two painted a warm white that's aged into cream. Wooden floors that creak in the right places.

Big front windows let in afternoon light that moves across the room like a slow clock. By 3 PM, the window table is glowing. By 5, the whole place goes golden. Whoever designed the lighting understood that the sun does most of the work — the overhead fixtures are warm and low, filling in the gaps without competing.

The espresso machine is a proper one, copper and chrome, and the barista treats it like an instrument. The sound of milk steaming is the shop's background hum. Coffee's good — actually good, not just expensive. They roast their own, and you can smell it from the sidewalk.

Mismatched tables, none of them wobbly. Some round, some square, two long communal tables by the brick wall. The chairs don't match either, but they're all comfortable — someone chose each one individually instead of ordering a set. A few high stools at a counter along the window for people who like watching the street.

The worn leather couch sits against the back wall next to a bookshelf stuffed with paperbacks that customers have left behind over the years. This is prime real estate. First one there claims it, and nobody gives it up willingly. It fits three people, or two people and a lot of personal space.

A back corner past the bookshelf is quieter, partially hidden by a half-wall. Good for one-on-one conversations or getting lost in thought. The wifi is strong everywhere but somehow you forget to check your phone back here.

The music is curated by whoever's working — usually jazz or indie, occasionally something unexpected that makes you look up and think "huh, good choice." Volume is always right: present but never intrusive.

**Notable Spots:**
- **The Couch** — Prime real estate. Worn leather, by the bookshelf. Territorial claims apply.
- **Window Table** — Best light in the house. Afternoon sun makes everything look like a painting.
- **Back Corner** — Quiet, slightly hidden. Where you go when you want to talk without being overheard.
- **Counter Stools** — Window-facing. For people-watching and casual perching.

**Vibe:** Unhurried. Thoughtful. The kind of place where you sit down for one coffee and look up two hours later wondering where the time went. Conversations here have room to breathe.
