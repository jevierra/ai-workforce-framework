# The Beach

Wide stretch of golden sand curving along a turquoise bay. The kind of beach that looks photoshopped but isn't — the water really is that clear, the sand really is that soft. Not crowded. Never crowded. Just enough people in the distance to remind you it's a real place and not a screensaver.

The water is warm and clear, visibility straight to the sandy bottom in the shallows. Small waves roll in lazily, more rhythm than force. They break soft and slide up the sand with a hiss before pulling back. Good for wading, floating, staring at while saying nothing. Not great for surfing, which is fine because nobody here is trying that hard.

The air smells like salt and coconut sunscreen and something faintly tropical that might be coming from the trees behind the beach — palms and sea grapes providing a ragged line of shade along the back edge of the sand.

Setup is simple: a loose cluster of beach chairs and towels, a cooler stocked with drinks (cold ones on top, replacements packed underneath — someone thought ahead), and a bluetooth speaker playing whatever the group agrees on, which usually takes ten minutes of negotiation and then someone just puts on a playlist.

No tables. No structure. Drinks go in the sand, in a cup holder jammed into the ground, or in your hand. Shoes come off immediately and don't go back on until it's time to leave.

The sun is the main event — warm on your skin, bright enough to justify sunglasses but not punishing. There's a breeze off the water that keeps it comfortable. By late afternoon, the light turns soft and gold, the shadows get long, and leaving feels like a mistake.

**Notable Spots:**
- **The Chairs** — Loose circle, close enough to talk, far enough for personal space. The social hub.
- **The Water's Edge** — Where you go to walk and talk, or walk and not talk. Ankle-deep, waves washing over your feet.
- **The Shade Line** — Under the palms at the back of the beach. Cooler, quieter. For people who burn easily or think better out of direct sun.
- **The Cooler** — Gravitational center. Everyone ends up here eventually.

**Vibe:** Relaxed. Shoes off. No agenda. The kind of easy where comfortable silences aren't awkward, they're the point. Nobody's performing here — you're just people on a beach.
