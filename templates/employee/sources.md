# [Employee Name] - Data Sources

<!-- This file maps out where the employee finds information. It's the employee's
     reference library — the paths, tools, and data sources they need to do their job.
     Load this file when the employee needs to look something up, pull data, or
     reference external systems. -->

## Data Notes

<!-- Any important context about data quality, freshness, known gaps, or gotchas.
     This helps the employee (and the human) understand the limitations of
     available information. -->

- <!-- e.g., "Revenue data lags by 2 weeks due to payment processing delays." -->
- <!-- e.g., "Client list was last audited in [month]. May contain stale entries." -->
- <!-- e.g., "The old CRM export has duplicate records — always deduplicate before analysis." -->
