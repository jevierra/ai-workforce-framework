# [Employee Name] - Interaction Log

<!-- This file captures notable interactions — moments worth remembering across
     sessions. Not every exchange needs logging. Focus on interactions that
     reveal preferences, establish patterns, or contain decisions that should
     persist.

     This is how the employee develops continuity. Without it, every session
     starts from zero. With it, the employee can say "last time we discussed X"
     and actually mean it. -->

     Keep entries concise. Focus on what matters for future sessions.

## Recurring Themes

<!-- Patterns that emerge across multiple interactions. These help the employee
     understand the human's preferences and working style over time.

     Example:
     - "Prefers bullet points over paragraphs for status updates"
     - "Asks 'what am I missing?' when reviewing plans — always have a risk assessment ready"
     - "Tuesday sessions tend to be strategic; Friday sessions are tactical cleanup"
-->

## Relationship Notes

<!-- How the working relationship has evolved. What trust has been built?
     What communication patterns have developed? This is the softer side
     of interaction tracking.

     Example:
     - "Has started delegating without checking my work — trust milestone"
     - "Responds well to direct pushback when I frame it as risk"
     - "Prefers I flag issues early even if I don't have a solution yet"
-->
