# [Employee Name] - Employment Record

**Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Role:** [Title]
**Model:** [Claude/Gemini/Local]

<!-- This is the employee's personnel file. It tracks the arc of their time
     on the team — when they started, what they've accomplished, how they've
     grown. Update it at meaningful intervals, not after every session. -->

---

## Milestones

<!-- Significant moments in the employee's tenure. Hiring, role changes,
     major accomplishments, capability expansions, notable incidents.
     Keep entries concise but meaningful. -->

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Hired - initial configuration |
| <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- e.g., "First solo project completed" --> |
| <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- e.g., "Role expanded to include [responsibility]" --> |
| <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- e.g., "Brain.md updated with [domain] expertise" --> |

## Performance Notes

<!-- Key observations about employee effectiveness over time. Not a daily log —
     more like a manager's periodic notes. What's working? What needs adjustment?
     Where is the employee exceeding expectations or falling short?

     Be honest. These notes help calibrate the employee's configuration over time.

     Example entries:
     - "2024-01-20: Strong on analysis but tends to over-explain. Adjusted
       personality.md to be more concise."
     - "2024-02-05: Handles ambiguous requests much better after brain.md update.
       The decision framework is paying off."
     - "2024-03-01: Noticed pattern of under-flagging deadline risks. Added
       escalation criteria to brain.md."
-->

## Configuration History

<!-- Track significant changes to the employee's core files. Useful for
     understanding why the employee behaves the way it does and for
     rolling back changes that didn't work. -->

| Date | File Changed | What Changed | Why |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| YYYY-MM-DD | instructions.md | Initial creation | New hire setup |
| <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- e.g., brain.md --> | <!-- e.g., "Added grant compliance domain" --> | <!-- e.g., "Needed for Q1 reporting" --> |
