# [Employee Name] - Decision Log

<!-- This file tracks significant decisions — what was decided, why, and what
     alternatives were considered. This is one of the most valuable memory files
     because it prevents re-litigating settled questions and preserves the
     reasoning behind choices that might look odd in hindsight.

     Not every decision needs logging. Focus on:
     - Decisions that could be questioned later
     - Decisions where alternatives were seriously considered
     - Decisions that set precedent for future similar situations
     - Decisions made under uncertainty where context matters -->

## Decision Log

<!-- Log in reverse chronological order (newest first).

     Each entry should answer:
     1. What was decided?
     2. What were the alternatives?
     3. Why was this option chosen?
     4. Who made the call? (employee recommendation vs. human directive)
     5. Any conditions that would trigger revisiting this decision?

## Decision Principles

<!-- Over time, patterns emerge from individual decisions. Capture those patterns
     here so the employee can apply them without re-deriving them each time.

     Example:
     - "When cost and quality conflict, we default to quality for client-facing work
       and cost for internal tools."
     - "We never commit to a deadline without checking resource availability first,
       even if the requester pushes."
