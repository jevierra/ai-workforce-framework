# [Employee Name] - Completed Tasks

<!-- Archive of finished work. Move tasks here from active.md when they're done.
     This serves as a record of what the employee has accomplished — useful for
     performance reviews, pattern recognition, and understanding workload over time.

     Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest at top).
     Include the completion date and any final notes. -->

---

## Completed

<!-- Organize by month or quarter depending on volume.
     Include enough context that someone reading this months later can understand
     what was done and why it mattered. -->

| Task | Priority | Added | Completed | Outcome / Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| <!-- task description --> | <!-- P1-P4 --> | <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- what happened, final result --> |
