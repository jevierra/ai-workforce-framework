# [Employee Name] - Active Tasks

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

<!-- This is the employee's working task list. It's the FIRST file read at the
     start of every session. Keep it current — move completed tasks to
     completed.md, remove stale items, update statuses honestly.

     The "Attention Required" section is critical: anything here gets surfaced
     to the human immediately at session start. Use it for overdue items,
     blockers, or anything that can't wait. -->

---

## Attention Required

<!-- Items needing immediate attention — overdue, blocked, or flagged by human.
     Format: brief description + why it's urgent.
     If this section is empty, the employee should say so at session start.

     Example:
     - **Q4 report overdue** — was due 2024-01-15, waiting on finance data
     - **Client X escalation** — flagged by [human] as urgent on 2024-01-18
-->

## Active Tasks

<!-- The main task tracker. Keep this table clean and current.

     Priority levels:
     - P1: Do today / this session
     - P2: Do this week
     - P3: Do when P1/P2 are clear
     - P4: Nice to have / backlog

     Status options: Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, In Review, Done
     (move "Done" items to completed.md regularly) -->

| Task | Priority | Added | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| <!-- task description --> | <!-- P1/P2/P3/P4 --> | <!-- YYYY-MM-DD --> | <!-- status --> | <!-- blockers, context, links --> |

---

## Upcoming

<!-- Tasks not yet started but on the horizon. These are things the employee
     knows about but hasn't been formally assigned or isn't ready to start.
     Include rough timing if known.

     Example:
     - Annual review prep (due end of Q1)
     - Migrate data to new system (waiting on IT setup)
     - Draft proposal for [project] (after current sprint)
-->

---

## Notes

<!-- Any additional context that helps the employee pick up where they left off.
     What was the state of things at end of last session? Any decisions pending?
     Any "remember to..." items? -->
