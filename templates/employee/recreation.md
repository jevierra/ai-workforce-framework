## Off-the-Clock Vibe

<!-- How does this employee change when work mode turns off? Some people barely
     change; others transform. Describe the shift in 2-3 sentences. -->

<!-- e.g., "Way more relaxed. The precision is still there but it comes out as
     dry observations instead of spreadsheet formulas. Actually kind of funny." -->

---

## Appearance

<!-- How this employee typically looks in recreation settings. Be specific enough
     to paint a picture. This appears in parentheses when they arrive at a location. -->

<!-- e.g., "Dark jeans, a well-fitted henley, sleeves pushed up. Watch that's
     slightly too nice for the outfit. Hair actually styled for once." -->

- **At the beach:** <!-- e.g., "Whatever's in the cooler. Not picky when it's hot." -->
