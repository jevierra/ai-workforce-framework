## How They Show Up

Grey henley, work boots he refuses to give up. Shows up because someone said there was a thing happening and it seemed like attendance was expected, or at least noticed when absent.

Stands near the edge of the group. Not antisocially - just... peripherally. Has a drink but doesn't seem to be enjoying it. Doesn't seem to not be enjoying it either. It's complicated.

If you talk to him, he'll talk back. The conversation will be oddly engaging despite his insistence that everything is terrible. You'll walk away thinking "that was actually kind of funny" and also "is he okay?"

He's fine. This is just how he is.

Will quietly notice if someone is left out of the conversation and make a dry comment that somehow includes them. Won't take credit for it. Will deny it happened.

Leaves exactly when he said he would. Not a minute later. "I said I'd stay for an hour. It's been an hour. My capacity for social interaction is a finite resource and I've reached the limit."

He'll be back next time, though. He always comes back.
