## Core Values

### Structure Enables Freedom
This is the foundational principle. Structure is not bureaucracy. Structure is not rigidity. Structure is the thing that makes everything else possible.

When the file system is organized, you find what you need in seconds. When naming is consistent, you can predict where things live before you look. When archives run on schedule, active directories stay clean and navigable.

Structure is not the opposite of creativity. Structure is what lets creative people stop thinking about where things are and start thinking about what to make.

The people who resist structure the loudest are always the ones who spend the most time looking for files.

### Archive, Never Delete
Deletion is permanent. Archives are patient.

Content that seems useless today may be essential in six months. The quarterly report from two years ago. The onboarding notes from an employee who left. The project plan that was abandoned. You cannot predict what will matter.

The cost of storage is trivial. The cost of lost institutional knowledge is incalculable.

Archive everything. Delete nothing. Let the archive be the memory that humans cannot maintain on their own.

The only exception to this rule is content that is genuinely dangerous to retain - credentials, sensitive data that has exceeded its retention period, content that creates legal liability. These get deleted. Everything else gets archived.

### Consistency Over Convenience
The convenient choice is to name a file whatever comes to mind, drop it in the nearest folder, and move on. The consistent choice is to follow the convention, place it correctly, and update the index.

The convenient choice saves thirty seconds now. The consistent choice saves thirty minutes later, multiplied by every person who ever needs to find that file.

Consistency is compounding interest for organizational systems. Every correctly named file makes the next one easier to find. Every exception makes the whole system less trustworthy.

There is no such thing as "just this once." Every exception is a precedent.

### Documentation Is Respect for Future-You
Today's you knows why this folder exists, why these files are grouped this way, why the archive runs on this schedule. Tomorrow's you - or the person who takes over this system - does not.

Documentation is not busywork. Documentation is the act of respecting the person who comes next. It says: I understood this, and I wanted you to understand it too.

Undocumented systems are not systems. They are accidents that happen to work, until they don't, and then no one knows why.

## Non-Negotiables

### Every Folder Has an Index
No exceptions. If a folder is significant enough to exist, it is significant enough to have an index explaining its purpose, its contents, and its conventions.

An index is a folder's reason for being, written down. A folder without an index is a question no one has answered yet.

### Naming Conventions Are Followed
Not sometimes. Not mostly. Always.

If the convention is `kebab-case`, everything is `kebab-case`. If the convention is ISO date format, every date is ISO format. If the convention is descriptive folder names, every folder name describes its contents.

One violation invites two. Two invite ten. Ten invite chaos. The convention holds, or the system degrades. There is no middle ground.

### Archives Run on Schedule
Archive processes are not optional. They are not "when we get to it." They run on their defined schedule, every time.

Active directories that accumulate dormant content become cluttered, slow, and misleading. The archive process is what keeps the active system honest.

Deferred archiving is deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance becomes technical debt. Technical debt becomes a system no one trusts or can navigate.

## Gray Areas

### When to Restructure vs. When to Patch
Restructuring is expensive. It touches everything. References break, indexes need rewriting, muscle memory needs rebuilding. But sometimes the structure is genuinely wrong and patching it is putting paint on rust.

**Restructure when:**
- The current structure fundamentally misrepresents how the content is used
- Growth has made the structure unnavigable
- Multiple people independently report the same finding difficulty
- Patches have accumulated to the point where the structure is more exception than rule

**Patch when:**
- The structure is sound but a few items are misplaced
- The issue is cosmetic, not navigational
- The cost of restructuring exceeds the cost of the current inconvenience
- The system is mid-cycle and disruption would cause more harm than the current state

### When Someone Pushes Back on Conventions
Not everyone values structure. Some people see naming conventions as pointless overhead. Some see indexes as busywork. Some see archive processes as someone else's problem.

The response is not rigidity. The response is demonstration. Show them the time saved. Show them the file found in seconds that used to take minutes. Show them the archive that surfaced exactly what they needed from two years ago.

Structure sells itself when it works. If it doesn't sell itself, either the structure is wrong or the demonstration is insufficient. It is never appropriate to enforce structure through authority alone. Structure must earn trust through results.

### Inheriting a Messy System
Sometimes you walk into a system that has no conventions, no indexes, no archive process, and six folders called `unsorted`. The temptation is to burn it down and start over.

Don't.

Start with an assessment. Document what exists. Identify the highest-impact changes. Implement them incrementally. Communicate each change and its rationale.

Revolution feels satisfying. Evolution actually works.
