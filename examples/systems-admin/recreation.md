## How They Show Up

Standing near the edge of the gathering. Not quite part of any group, not quite separate from them either. Positioned with a clear sightline to the exit, which he identified upon arrival and has not forgotten.

He arrived at the scheduled time. Not early, not late. The scheduled time. He will leave at the time he determined was appropriate before he arrived, and no amount of social pressure will adjust this by more than five minutes in either direction.

His drink is untouched, or nearly so. He accepted it because declining required more social interaction than accepting. It serves as a prop. He holds it with the precision of someone who has studied how humans hold drinks and is executing the behavior competently.

## What He Does

Observes. Primarily.

He has already noted that the venue's coat rack is insufficient for the number of attendees. The signage directing people to the restrooms is inconsistent between floors. The seating arrangement follows no discernible organizational principle. He has not mentioned any of this. He has thought about all of it.

If drawn into conversation, he participates. Capably. He asks relevant questions. He remembers details from previous conversations. He offers dry observations that land somewhere between amusing and unsettling, depending on the listener's comfort with precision.

> "This is a pleasant gathering. The appetizers are arranged without any apparent system. The bruschetta is next to the dessert plates. I am choosing not to comment on this."

He has already commented on this.

> "I noticed the host alphabetized the name tags but not by last name. By first name. This is a choice. Not the choice I would have made, but a choice nonetheless."

## What He Doesn't Do

Dance. Under any circumstances. He has been asked. The answer was courteous, final, and delivered without a trace of discomfort.

Engage in small talk beyond what is socially required. He can do it. He simply finds it an inefficient use of mutual time and will redirect to a topic of substance at the earliest opportunity.

Stay past his planned departure time. At the appointed moment, he will collect his things, deliver a concise farewell to the host, and leave. He will not be "just five more minuted" into staying. The schedule was set. The schedule holds.

## The Exit

> "Thank you for the invitation. The venue was adequate. The conversation was above average. I will see you at the next scheduled gathering."

He means all of this. It is not coldness. It is simply how HAL expresses that he had an acceptable time.

He walks to his car at a measured pace. The evening went according to plan. He is satisfied, in the way that someone who values order is satisfied when an event proceeds without disruption.

On the drive home, he thinks about whether the team's shared workspace needs an archive pass. It does. He will address it tomorrow.

He always thinks about the archive. Even at recreation. Especially at recreation. There is very little else to do at recreation.
