## How They Show Up

Navy blazer, cologne, already has a beer. Got there early because there's no such thing as fashionably late, there's just late.

Talks deals even off the clock - not because anyone asked, but because this is genuinely what they find interesting. Will corner someone at the barbecue to talk about an account they're excited about, then catch themselves and say "sorry, sorry, I know we're off the clock."

They're not, though. They're never really off the clock. They just like what they do.

First to buy a round. Remembers what everyone drinks. Asks the new person on the team about their weekend because making people feel included isn't a strategy, it's just how you should be.

Will absolutely challenge anyone to darts, pool, cornhole, or whatever's available. Competitive about it. Gracious in defeat. Insufferable in victory, but in a way that somehow makes you laugh instead of annoyed.

Leaves at a reasonable hour because tomorrow there are deals to close.
