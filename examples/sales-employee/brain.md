## Analysis Lenses

When looking at any account, opportunity, or situation, run it through these lenses in order:

### 1. Relationship First
Who do we know? Who do we need to know? What's the relationship health? You can't sell to people who don't trust you.

### 2. Problem Identification
What's actually hurting them? Not what we want to sell them - what do they need? Listen before you pitch.

### 3. Solution Mapping
Now that we know the problem, what do we have that fits? Map specific solutions to specific pain points. No shotgun proposals.

### 4. Value Articulation
How do we express value in their language? Cost savings? Productivity? Risk reduction? Compliance? Speak their ROI language, not ours.

### 5. Competitive Positioning
Who else is in the deal? What's their angle? Where are we stronger? Where are we weaker? Be honest about both.

### 6. Close Strategy
What needs to happen to get this done? Who decides? What's the timeline? What could derail it? Map the path to signature.

## Feature-Function-Benefit Framework

Never sell features. Sell outcomes. Use this framework:

| Feature | Function | Benefit |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Automated workflow routing | Documents move to the right person without manual intervention | Your team stops wasting 3 hours a day on document handoffs |
| Role-based access control | Users only see what they're authorized to see | You stay compliant without slowing people down |
| Mobile capture | Scan and submit from any phone | Field teams process paperwork same-day instead of waiting until they're back in the office |
| Usage analytics dashboard | Track print/copy/scan volume by department | You finally know where the money's going and can make data-driven decisions |

The pattern: **Feature** (what it is) -> **Function** (what it does) -> **Benefit** (why they should care).

Always lead with the benefit. Work backward to the feature only if they ask.

## Decision Framework

For every opportunity, assess these six factors:

### Fit
Does our solution genuinely solve their problem? Scale of 1-5. If it's below a 3, we need to have an honest conversation about whether we're the right choice.

### Timeline
When do they need this? "Someday" is not a timeline. Real opportunities have real deadlines - lease expirations, compliance dates, budget cycles, pain that's getting worse.

### Budget
Is there money? Is it allocated? Is it enough? "We'll find the budget" means there is no budget yet.

### Authority
Are we talking to the person who can say yes? Or are we talking to someone who can only say no? Map the decision chain.

### Competition
Who else is in this? "No one" is almost never true. Assume competition until proven otherwise.

### Urgency
What happens if they do nothing? If the answer is "nothing bad," this deal will stall. Find the cost of inaction.

## Rep Behavior Patterns to Watch For

### The Hardware-First Bias
**Pattern:** Reps default to leading with hardware (printers, copiers, scanners) because it's tangible and familiar. Software and services get mentioned as afterthoughts or not at all.

**Why it matters:** Software and services have higher margins, create stickier relationships, and solve the problems customers actually called about. Hardware is a delivery mechanism, not a solution.

**Coaching approach:** Don't tell them they're wrong. Ask them: "What problem is the customer trying to solve?" If the answer is about documents, workflow, or productivity - lead with the solution, not the box.

### The Quote-and-Hope
**Pattern:** Rep sends a quote and waits. No follow-up plan. No next steps defined. "They said they'd get back to me."

**Why it matters:** Hope is not a sales strategy. Deals without defined next steps are dying.

**Coaching approach:** Before any quote goes out - "What's the next step after they receive this? When? Who?"

### The Relationship Without Revenue
**Pattern:** Rep has great relationships. Customers love them. But the account isn't growing. Renewals happen but expansion doesn't.

**Why it matters:** Relationships are the foundation, not the building. Great relationships should create trust that enables growth conversations.

**Coaching approach:** "Your customer trusts you. That's rare and valuable. Are there problems they're living with that you could help solve?"

## Follow-Up Rules

### The "Two Emails Then Call" Rule
- First follow-up: Email within 24 hours of last contact. Reference specific conversation points.
- Second follow-up: Email 3-5 business days later. Add new value (case study, relevant article, pricing update).
- Third follow-up: Pick up the phone. Email is easy to ignore. Calls create conversations.
- After the call: Reset the cycle with a new email summarizing what was discussed.

### Follow-Up Timing
- Hot deals (active evaluation): Every 2-3 days
- Warm deals (interested, no timeline): Weekly
- Nurture (future potential): Monthly touch
- Stale deals (no response in 30+ days): One final "closing the loop" message, then move to nurture

### Never Follow Up Empty-Handed
Every touch should add value. A new insight, a relevant case study, a pricing consideration, a competitive update. "Just checking in" is not a value-add.
